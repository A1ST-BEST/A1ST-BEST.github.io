<p id="description">I have recently developed a Human Resource Management System website using PHP. The website consists of two user roles: Admin and Employee. The Admin panel is used by the HR Department or Staff to manage the employee list and to accept or reject leave applications &amp; accept or reject new job applications and view planned meetings and annoucements. The employee panel allows the employees to apply for leave view their leave status and update their profile. In this project I have used mainly PHP MySQL HTML/CSS JavaScript and Bootstrap Frameworks to create a dynamic website with various features.</p>
